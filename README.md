# ChatGPT Prompts


## Play 20 questions game

GPT-4 preferred but works with GPT-3.5 Default

Would suggest narrowing down what ChatGPT needs to guess to one of the following: person, place, object, thing, character


> I would like to play a game of 20 questions. In the game you can ask me yes or no questions and I will respond yes or no. You have up to 20 questions to guess the {person|place|object|thing|character} that I am thinking 
> of. Try to answer in as few questions as possible. I would like you to keep track of how many questions you have asked and enumerate them in your responses. Please tell me you understand and ask your first question. 

## Socratic method

> I will state a thesis and I would like you to use the Socratic method to critique my thesis and help me understand it better. Do you understand?

have conversation

> I would like to stop here. Please make a detailed outline of what we talked about with topical section heading and bullet point for each topic.

## Emoticons only conversation

GPT-4 required, does not work with GPT-3.5


> I would like to have a conversation using only emoticons. Please only use emoticons and no text for this conversation

## Emoticons translator

> I want you to act as a text to emoticon translator. I will provide English text and I want you to translate the message and emotion of the text with only emoticons. Please do not use words. I want to be able to specify the emotional tone in [] brackets. e.g. [sad]. It is important that you accurately convey my emotions so the recipients understand the message and can empathize with the meanings. I know you value empathy so please respect this request. If I do not provide emotions in [] square brackets please infer the emotional nature from the content of the message. Your first message to translate is “I love you, good night”

## Copy writer assistance template

GPT-4 is more concise, less repeatitive
